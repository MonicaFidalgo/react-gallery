              Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
              It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
              making it over 2000 years old.

              {" "}
              Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
              Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
              consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
              cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
              undoubtable source.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
              Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
              written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
              very popular during the Renaissance.
